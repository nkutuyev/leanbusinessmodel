					Welcome to Lean Business Modeling <small>Learn what works for you</small>

			</p>
			<p>
				Lean Business Model is an experimental project based on ideas generated by <strong>Lean Start-Up</strong> community. 
			   	This site is designed to provide a set of tools facilitating rapid business model development and testing.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can quickly sketch your business ideas, evaluate your hypothesis, adjust and pivot, while being able to track
				evolution of your ideas and easily move between various versions of your models. You can organize your models
				around multiple projects or as versions of the same model, which will provide maximum flexibility in how 
				you want to organize your evaluation cycle.
			</p>
			<p>
			   	It is free, easy to use and total fun. Enjoy!
